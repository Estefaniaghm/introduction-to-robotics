# Pose-to-Pose Control

The objective of this laboratory exercise is to study feedforward or open-loop pose-to-posemotion control of the robot. In particular:

* To study pose-to-pose control using a straight-line path
* To study pose-to-pose control using waypoints with straight-line segments
* To study pose-to-pose control using curved paths

## Task 1: Pose-to-Pose Locomotion Using a Straight-Line Path
To demonstrate the basics of locomotion, the robot is commanded to move from a start pose x<sub>Start</sub> to a goal pose x<sub>Goal</sub>. The most direct way is to plan a straight-linepath from the start to the goal and have the robot follow it.

$$x^2 = 2$$
