# Sensor & Actuator Programming

The objective of this laboratory exercise is to familiarize with the equipment and software that will be used for all labs and the project in ROB301. In particular:
* To learn about the robot’s hardware and its suite of sensors
* To learn how to write ROS programs to command the robot, i.e., 
  * How to write a simple Python ROS node
  * How to upload to the Waffle Pi
  * How to acquire data from the sensors
  * How to drive the actuators
